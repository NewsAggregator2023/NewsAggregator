# Coding standards
We will initially use the coding standards of the languages and libraries we use, however we anticipate that we will add our own as we gain a greater understanding of the project.
As a baseline, we must:
+ Use docstrings to comment code
+ Make it as modular as possible
+ Limit coupling and promote cohesion
+ Use appropriate naming conventions
# Documentation standards
+ Any valuable documents are to be uploaded or linked to GitHub to allow for easy central access.
# Mangement Process standards
+ Regularly update the project management tool to reflect changes
# Version Control standards
+ Have informative commit messages except for trivial, regular changes (e.g, markup formatting or fixing links)
# Meeting standards
+ Treat all members with respect
+ Use a diplomatic process to resolve diasagreements
# Communication standards
+ Respond within 24 hours
+ Announce absenses in advance
