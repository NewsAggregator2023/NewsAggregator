# Tutorial Conflict

Description: 
> The allocated tutorial time had a conflict. This was due to the selected time having a rating of 'good' despite having an unresolvable conflict. 
> The process we used to determine which time was most suitable was by ranking how many conflicts each tutorial time had. 
> This treated each conlict equally which was not the case. The binary available/unavailable was convenient to fill but not each conflict was equal. 
> For the preferences, each tutorial option received a value based on how many conflicts it had, which was normalised between very good and very bad. 
> As there was only one option with no conflicts and three with only one, these were the top four preferences. 
> Since we had limited availability for everyone, we ensured that tutorial spots were ranked so that we were not allocated to a worse spot if we could not get allocated to out top 4. 
> (ie, we tried to make rank the options to be as informative as possible if we didn't get our top 4).
> However, this meant the spot we were given had a 'good' description which didn't match the reality.
> This meant that the member with the conflict was not able to attend the given tutorial.
