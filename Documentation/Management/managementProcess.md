# Management Process and Principles
## Principles
Due to being a small project team, we need to keep the documentation and management of the project as light as possible to ensure we can deliver valuable outcomes. 
Where possible, we can use automation and templates to simplify our process.
By having project management and version control in one place, we can directly reference commits and code.
Tracking and reporting will allow us to measure our performance and guide reflection upon our processes.

## Zenhub 
Zenhub is a browser extension which adds project management features directly into github. It also has the added benefit of being free to use. 

Zenhub does require an account to view the content, but a github account is not required. You can find the extension download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd).
