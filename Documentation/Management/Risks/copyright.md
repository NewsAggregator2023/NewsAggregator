Description: Copyright Infringement
> As we are using automated processes to collect data about other organisations news articles, there is a risk we could face copyright litigation if an image has a copyright license. 

Relevant stakeholders (and impact):
+ Sources: Threatened by our aggregator, loss of royalties and potentially copyright concerns for them.
+ Tom: Has to deal with legal ramifications including legal costs, public image and fixing application.

Relevant goals: 
> B, B.1, B.1.3

Assignee:
> Whole team and Client

Trigger (what causes it to become a problem):
> An image with copyright protection is released on the news aggregator platform

Symptom/cause:
> Insufficient methods were undertaken to ensure program is copyright compliant

## Possible Actions
Name: Use copyright free images

Approaches from the hierarchy of control (elimination, substitution, isolation, process): substitution

implications/ new risks:
+ Need to ensure that images are of sufficient quality
+ Need to get them from reliable sources with a large image base
+ Are able to show uses images, which is more appealing than plain text

Name: Generic image

Approaches from the hierarchy of control (elimination, substitution, isolation, process): elimination

implications/ new risks:
+ Are able to show uses images, which is more appealing than plain text
+ Is not as informative about the article

Name: Proof check image sources

Approaches from the hierarchy of control (elimination, substitution, isolation, process): process

implications/ new risks:
+ Time consuming
+ Not guaranteed to yield a result (no copyright found does not guarantee an image is copyright free (e.g it came from a source which violated copyright))
+ Can use quality, relevant images

Name: Don't release platform to public

Approaches from the hierarchy of control (elimination, substitution, isolation, process): elimination

implications/ new risks:
+ You are not exposing images to copyright concerns
+ Platform is ultimately desired to be public, so withholding it violates business goals
+ Can safely be used while implementing other approaches

Log of decisions (decision, date, who was responsible, monitoring needed):
Don't release platform to public
