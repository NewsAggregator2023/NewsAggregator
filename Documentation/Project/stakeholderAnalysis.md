# Stakeholder Analysis
Based on our understanding of the project, we have developed a stakeholder analysis, and the following will show our analysis and understanding of the interest stakeholders. And will be used as part of our management of stakeholder expectations and decisions.

**Techlauncher Program**
Techlauncher Program will access our teamwork and give us feedback base on it. In this phase, they are focus on how we organize, work and deliver as a team. So they have big influences about what we are doing, but since they have big number of teams to monitor, we will identify that they only have limited interests of what we are doing now.

**Tom (and other clients)**
As project owners, their establishment of a project means that they, more than anyone else, understand the point of its existence. Our aim is to start based on their needs. So their influence on the project is also crucial.

**Commuters**
With our user profile, we believe that working people are our main audience group. They have a certain demand for understanding current affairs, on the other hand, they have a relatively fragmented time management. Usually between work, lunch break or some waiting time. We hope our app can help them to try the value in the fragmented time.

**Potential users**
Potential users i.e. people who also want to learn about current events and enrich themselves through fragmented time. Their needs are mostly the same, so they are basically the same and can be satisfied, except for a few other needs caused by individual differences. But their attention and influence on the project is certainly relatively low.

**NewsAggregator Team**
Our team of developers has its own direction for improving the technical stack or management level in the project. We want to improve ourselves through the project and coordinate to meet the multi-eye supervision system. We have some influence on the project execution, but our interest in the project mostly stays in the project itself.


**1.3 Stakeholder strategy:** 
Closely manage the relationship with Clients, expecially Tom.
Keep TechLauncher Team satisfied.
Talk to other stakeholders when we are necessary and have the capacity to do so.
