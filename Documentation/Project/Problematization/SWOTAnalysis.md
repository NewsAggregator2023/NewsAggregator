# SWOT Analysis

## Strengths
### What do we do well?
> NewsAggregator collates news content from different sources and represents them in one convenient web interface. 
> Articles are presented in a tiled format with an image, the title and a description. 
> Clicking on the tile brings you to the source website. In addition to not having much branding ourselves, this directs the attention to the source articles.
### What do we do better than our competition?
> Canberra does not have many local news aggregators, most are international or global. We are focused on providing content that is relevant to the Canberra community.
> While some news aggregators copy the article in their own website, we direct the user to the sources website to read the content which supports their business too. 
> Some of our competition uses adds to generate revenue, which reduces the user experience.
> Some news aggregators also include personalised results, which reduces the variety of content users can see and may be perceived as bias by users. 
> Personalised search can also reinforce opinions about divisive topics. 
### What positive aspects of the business give us a competitive advantage?
> News aggregators can provide users with easy access to a wide variety of content in one convenient location. 
> As a news source, this involves less work than producing articles or newspapers.
> We currently do not need to worry about producing new content or how we represent the original article.

## Weaknesses
### What and where can we improve?
> Currently, the images used as thumbnails would violate their copyright if the news aggregator was released.
> Due to this, articles would have to be published without images, which is much less appealing to users.
> 
### What do our competitors do better?
> Some of our competitors give users the option to refine and subscribe to topics they are interested in.
> They also address or remove spam or clickbait articles to improve overall user experience. 
> Some also offer daily picks and similar features. 
### Where are the gaps in our assets and resources (such as knowledge, cash or equipment)?
> As a small startup, we are limited by the tools we have available. 
> This includes access to public APIs or alternatively the computational power to develop our own solutions.
> The current team is also all new to the project and all have a lot to learn.
### Is the thing that sets us apart from our competition obvious?
> As a small solution, users will understand that to be viable we will have to be more relevant to their needs. 
> This may include superior personalisation and more relevant articles.
### How can we improve business processes?
> We can improve processes by keeping up to date with our competitors and investigating new approaches to be competitive in the digital environment.

## Opportunities
### What trends can we use to our advantage to increase use of our product or service?
> Canberra has few functional localised news aggregators that specialise around Canberra or Australia. 
> By producing an easy to use platform that appeals to users, we can provide news specific to certain public niches. 
### Are there any changes or events that might positively impact us (such as consumer behaviour, regulation, policies or new technology)?
> As newspapers are produced less or publishers close down, there is a gap in the market generated based on newspaper style in a digital or modern context.
### Has anything changed in the market that creates opportunity for us?
> Newspapers and similar news services are finding it difficult to remain competitive in a digital world. 
> News Aggregators are able to sieze this opportunity to fill certain gaps in news delivery without the overhead of producing original content.
> For example, many news platforms have limited customisation of how the news is presented at a high level. 
> We could apply stylng so that users have access to a platform which is more personal to them.
### Do the public like us?
> The news aggregator is not currently available to the public.

## Threats
### What factors beyond our control could place us at risk?
> Images from articles are protected by copyright, so content that is generated needs to be identifiably different to the source article's. 
> Any changes to the policies of copyright-free image providers would then expose a risk and reduce the extent of available content.
> As we are seeking a API based approach to start development at a higher level, any changes to the API could impact the function of our code.
> Before releasing the aggregator, we also need to ensure that the content is factually correct and suitable, which could require significant time for human checkers.
### What potential competitors may enter the market?
> Some competitors may use chatbots like chatgpt to generate articles, which will have superior capability to rewrite articles, potentially in a better style.
### Are our resource and material supplies unstable or insecure?
> Our resources and materials should remain secure. 
### Are there any changes or events that might negatively impact us (such as consumer behaviour, regulation, policies or new technology)?
> News sources preventing news aggregators from using their content would limit the availability of articles on our platform.
> Any changes in legal policy about article distribution could also pose significant issues. 
> If a more local news aggregator becomes available or international ones become more used, we could have difficulty entering the market given more competition.
