# SWOT Analysis

## Strengths
What do we do well?
> NewsAggregator collates news content from different sources and represents them in one convenient web interface. 
> Based on user preferences, either the source website's logo or a generic image is produced to add visualisation to the article. 
> Website branding is also used to determine article colour themes.
What do we do better than our competition?
> 
What unique assets do we have internally (such as knowledge, background, network, reputation or skills) and externally (such as customers, patents, technology or capital)?
What positive aspects of the business give us a competitive advantage?

## Weaknesses
What and where can we improve?
> Currently, we use generic images to make articles more appealing to prevent copyright infringement. 
> However, these generic images are less appealing than images generated uniquely based on the article text content.
What do our competitors do better?
Where are the gaps in our assets and resources (such as knowledge, cash or equipment)?
Is the thing that sets us apart from our competition obvious?
How can we improve business processes?

## Opportunities
What trends can we use to our advantage to increase use of our product or service?
Are there any changes or events that might positively impact us (such as consumer behaviour, regulation, policies or new technology)?
> As newspapers are produced less or publishers close down, there is a gap in the market generated based on newspaper style in a digital or modern context.
Has anything changed in the market that creates opportunity for us?
Do the public like us?

## Threats
What factors beyond our control could place us at risk?
> Images from articles are protected by copyright, so content that is generated needs to be identifiably different to the source article's. 
What potential competitors may enter the market?
> Some competitors may use chatgpt to generate articles, which will have superior capability to rewrite articles, potentially in a better style.
Are our resource and material supplies unstable or insecure?
Are there any changes or events that might negatively impact us (such as consumer behaviour, regulation, policies or new technology)?
> News sources preventing news aggregators from using their content.
