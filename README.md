# NewsAggregator Techlauncher 2023

Welcome to the NewsAggregator techlauncher landing page!

## Sales Pitch

NewsAggregator aims to produce a news outlet which collects news into one convenient and personable platform.

How often do you find yourself sailing the vast sea of news, wondering how long until you find the right article to set down and read? It might be that you see the same news, no matter which platform you choose, or that so much of it is filled with the same shallow content. Perhaps the news supplied just isn't local enough, or you miss the personable sensation of reading a newspaper over breakfast? 

Using machine learning, NewsAggregator is your "news in a can". Take it where you want to go and relax knowing the up-to-date news won't bulk you down. Be provided with generative pictures in a style for you, whether the texture of broadsheet or the quirky like flintstone.
